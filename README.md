- La Push

  - **Oregon State University**: https://data.ioos.us/gliders/providers/operators/Oregon%20State%20University/deployments. Note that it should be lumped with the above deployments, but ended up having a different "contributor/provider/operator" string.
  - **12/14/2018 note:** The current deployment (started 2018-11) doesn't appear under either of those two providers/operators. It's been flagged differently. Look it up under Fred Bahr

### NANOOS deployments listed in the Glider DAC ERDDAP
- https://data.ioos.us/gliders/erddap/search/index.html?searchFor=NANOOS
- 30 matching datasets (as of 2/4/2017) -- seems to catch all NANOOS-associated deployments! Probably the only system that does.

### NANOOS deployments listed in the new IOOS Catalog under the Glider DAC organization
- https://data.ioos.us/dataset?q=nanoos&organization=glider-dac
- Each deployment record is duplicated (the second set only has ERDDAP services)
- Neither the CMOP nor the Trinidad Head NANOOS-CeNCOOS deployments are listed!
