## Glider DAC
### NANOOS deployments listed in the Glider DAC "catalog v2" by "contributor/provider/operator"
- **nanoos-uw**: https://data.ioos.us/gliders/providers/operators/nanoos-uw/deployments. Note, as of 1/5/2017, the blank attribution field and absent WMO ID's
- **Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction, Oregon Health & Science University**: https://data.ioos.us/gliders/providers/operators/Center%20for%20Coastal%20Margin%20Observation%20and%20Prediction%2C%20Oregon%20Health%20%26%20Science%20University/deployments
- **Oregon State University (NANOOS/CeNCOOS)**: https://data.ioos.us/gliders/providers/operators/Oregon%20State%20University%20(NANOOS/CeNCOOS)/deployments
- **Oregon State University**: https://data.ioos.us/gliders/providers/operators/Oregon%20State%20University/deployments. Note that it should be lumped with the above deployments, but ended up having a different "contributor/provider/operator" string.

### NANOOS deployments listed in the Glider DAC ERDDAP
- https://data.ioos.us/gliders/erddap/search/index.html?searchFor=NANOOS
- 27 matching datasets (as of 1/5/2017) -- seems to catch all NANOOS-associated deployments! Probably the only system that does.

### NANOOS deployments listed in the new IOOS Catalog under the Glider DAC organization
- https://data.ioos.us/dataset?q=nanoos&organization=gliderdac
- Each deployment record is duplicated (the second set only has ERDDAP services)
- Neither the CMOP nor the Trinidad Head NANOOS-CeNCOOS deployments are listed!
